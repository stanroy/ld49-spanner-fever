This repo is mainly to show the source code for the game.

The actual game can be played [here](https://stanroy.itch.io) 

## Description

The theme of the game jam was <b>Unstable</b>.

I used Godot to make this game and had fun while making it. I made all of the 3d models myself using Blender.

The game is simple. Collect all of the spanners in a level within a time limit to avoid the engine becoming unstable and blowing up.
